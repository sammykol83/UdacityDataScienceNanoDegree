The purpose of this file is to describe the features of the data, since there's no "concentrated" explanation.
The features were collected from several databases and part of them were estimated from other features.
The referrals to the databases from which the features were taken can be found in the Joule article:

"DeepSolar: A Machine Learning Framework to Efficiently Construct a Solar Deployment Database in the United States"
in section: 1.2 - Other Data
