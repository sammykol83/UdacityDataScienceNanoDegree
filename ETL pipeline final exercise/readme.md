# Project - ETL Pipeline final exercise

Simple Extract Transform Load exercise from Udacity

## Quick start <a name="quick-start"></a>
* Just run the *.py file. (Was derived from a *.ipynb file, hence the weird layout). 

## Short inner workings description <a name="short-inner-workings-description"></a>
The project loads data from a *.csv file, does some transformations
and then writes it into an SQL database.
All the data required for the project is contained within it.
